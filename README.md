# Implement a design from scratch

#### In this project, i will implement from scratch, without any library, a web page. i will use all HTML/CSS/Accessibility/Responsive design knowledges that i learned previously.

#### i wonâ€™t have a lot of instruction, i'm free to implement it the way that i want - the objective is simple: Have a fully functional web page that looks the same as the designer file.

## Here the final result:

# version desktop :
# Version tablet :
# Version mobile :
