# Implement a design from scratch

#### In this project, i will implement from scratch, without any library, a web page. i will use all HTML/CSS/Accessibility/Responsive design knowledges that i learned previously.

#### i wonâ€™t have a lot of instruction, i'm free to implement it the way that i want - the objective is simple: Have a fully functional web page that looks the same as the designer file.

## Interactions note:

- the web page must switch to the mobile version when the screen width is 480px or less
- links hover/active: #FF6565
- button hover/active: opacity: 0.9
- max width of the content: 1000px centered in the page

## Here the final result:

# version desktop :
# Version tablet :
# Version mobile :

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://samdaph.com/portfolio/desk.jpg" width="1000" title="hover text">
</p>

#### This webpage has been designed by Nicolas Philippot, UI/UX designer.
